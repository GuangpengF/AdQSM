# AdQSM
AdQSM is a new tree quantitative structure model (QSM) that can reconstruct the 3D branch geometry of individual tree from Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) point clouds. Many attributes of the trunk or branch can also be quantitatively calculated (as shown in the table below). For example, tree volume (trunk and branch), DBH and tree height parameters can be extracted directly. It allows point clouds collected by different sensors to serve as input point clouds. In addition to TLS, UAV LiDAR, mobile LiDAR, SLAM and even photogrammetry are also included under the premise of appropriate point cloud density.
